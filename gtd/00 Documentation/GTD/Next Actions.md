# Next Actions

### What is a Next Action?

A "task" in GTD is more correctly termed a **Next Action**. A Next Action is "[the next visible physical activity required to move something forward](https://gettingthingsdone.com/2011/02/how-is-a-next-action-list-different-from-a-to-do-list/)". It may be part of a larger project, or it may be a single standalone item.

*"Call mum and wish her a happy birthday"* is an example of a Next Action.

*"Buy a new car"* is not a Next Action; it is a project which needs to be broken down into smaller component steps. The Next Action for that project might be to *"Spend 20 minutes researching the current safest car models."*

### Why a "Next Action list" is so critical compared to a task list

The reason that Next Actions are so critical in GTD is because of the mental load required when looking at a classic task list.

Have a read through this task list, written the way that most people write them:

**The standard task list:**

1. Renovate the bathroom
2. Start a fitness blog
3. Plan company annual retreat
4. Do personal tax return
5. Launch 3 new products by January
6. Learn French
7. Plan surprise party for Bob

How do you feel when you look at that? Probably quite stressed out, and certainly very easy to procrastinate. 

*Plan annual company retreat??* Sounds awful and like a lot of work!

Compare the exact same list of projects, but written in a Next Actions style:

**The Next Actions list:**

1. Stop at the hardware store on the way home, and take photos of different tap
options.
2. Brainstorm 3 ideas for my fitness blog title.
3. Ask Julie what the budget is for the annual retreat.
4. Download tax form 1040 from the IRS website.
5. Ring Adam in marketing and ask him to send through the new product
briefings.
6. Ask Anne what was the name of the French school she recommended.
7. Call the Bluestone Bar on 555-1234 and book for the 17th of July.

Ask Julie what the budget is for the annual retreat? Well that's easy - I could do that right now! Writing your tasks out like this is a brilliant way to cut procrastination and speed up your output.
