This is a daily note. It is here as an example of excluding tasks under a heading.

Maybe you want to add some quick tasks that you thought of while journaling:

- [ ] Call [[ğŸ‘¤Mum]] and wish her a happy birthday ğŸ”¼

But you might have a daily habit tracker which you **don't** want to add to your master task list. In this case we can exclude the heading in the [tasks.js](../00%20Documentation/tasks.js.md) config.

## ğŸŒ± Daily Habits

- [ ] Drink a glass of water
- [ ] Work out for 30 minutes
- [ ] Take over the world
